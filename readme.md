- [ ] Calendar integrations.
- [ ] Coach and Manager Notification Board.
- [ ] Turn the Custom Application into more widely used app.
- [ ] Random Picture Display of the Events, Teams or Individual players.
- [ ] AuthO is a third(3'd) party HIPPA approved and compliant identity management system.
- [ ] Ability to give message alerts to parents if a telephone number or signed off form is incomplete.

## Challenges
- Time managing the two(2)-week sprint with all the features we would have liked to include in the project.
- Five(5) developers branching off to build features that were dependant on each other.
- Working with a team of developers on Zoom meetings across the USA and meeting for the first time.

## Triumphs
- The ability to update a Profile Photo.
- Communication between team when pushing up code from a branch without merge conflicts was incredibly efficient.
- Applied the knowledge form the sixteen(16)-week coarse at DigitalCrafts Bootcamp to incorporated that knowledge into using MangoDB Database we did not cover during class.

## Code Example Extraction
Data Base:
```
const connectDB = require('./config/db.js');
connectDB();

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useCreateIndex: true,
            useFindAndModify: false,
        });
        console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```
Team Model:
```
const teamController = require('./routes/teamRoutes.js');

app.use('/team', teamController);

const Team = require('../models/teamModel');

// Get All Teams
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    const team = await Team.find({});
    res.json(team);
});

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const teamSchema = mongoose.Schema(
    {
        teamName: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
    }
);

const Team = mongoose.model('Team', teamSchema);

module.exports = Team;
```
Cors:
```
const cors = require('cors');

const corsOptions = {
    origin: '*',
    methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE',
    preflightContinue: false,
    optionsSuccessStatus: 204,
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
